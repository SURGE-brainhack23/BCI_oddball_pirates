# BCI_oddball_pirates
This repository contains a PsychoPy script for a BCI speller paradigm. At the start of each block, participants will be presented with six gray silhouettes in a circular array, one of which will then turn pink and outlined with a pink box to identify the target stimulus. The pink silhouette will then turn back to gray, the pink box will disappear, and immediately after, the gray silhouettes will be replaced by their corresponding pirate face or a coloured silhouette for 500 ms each, one at a time in a random order. The experiment consists of 2 sets of 4 runs, each with a different experimental condition. The 8 conditions are:

- White, upright face silhouettes 
- Green, upright  face silhouettes
- White, inverted face silhouettes
- Green, inverted face silhouettes
Then after a longer breakâ€¦
- White, upright faces
- Green, upright  faces
- White, inverted faces
- Green, inverted faces

The participants are given a break after each run and between silhouettes and faces. The purpose of the silhouette conditions is to determine the contribution of facial features to the elicited ERPs and the resulting classification accuracies.

This paradigm only serves to generate data that can be used to train an offline classifier.
